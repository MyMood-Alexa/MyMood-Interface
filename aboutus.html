        <h3 class="text-warning">System Purpose</h3>
        <p> My Mood is an interactive Alexa application that would improve, assess, and get help for the user's mental state.
          <br><br>Depression not only has an impact on the individual person, it also has a great impact on the society around them.
          Unfortunately, depressed individuals tend to have limited knowledge and access to resources regarding their disorder.
          <br><br>The system provides tools for potentially depressed users, including:
            <ol>
              <li> Depression alleviation through conversation
              <li> Mental health diagnosis by taking an assessment
              <li> Location-based suggestion for professional help
            </ol>
          In addition, collected data from willing users are sent to UCLA for research.
          <br><br>The ultimate goal of the system is to give depressed users a coping mechanism through conversation, and to give them more knowledge of the available resources that can help them.
          Submitted research data would be towards a good cause and simultaneously improve the system.
          By doing so, we hope users will become more aware of their depression by encouraging them be more proactive in curing their depression.
